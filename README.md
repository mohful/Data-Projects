# Excel Data Project
Analyzed and reviewed raw data from air sampling across an urban region in Ontario from air monitoring stations in a high profile area. This 
area has significant interest from local community members, industry, and government who are concerned that the air quality is affecting their health. The provided raw data 
for analysis and interpretation is for ozone, fine particulate matter, and benzene.
